# pandas-100-puzzle-solutions

These are 100 puzzle solutions curated by [Alex Riley](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles).

I have been able to solve the first 28 puzzles. 
My method was to give myself a time limit of 15 - 20 mins to try and solve it.
I usually used the *dir* function to show different methods the dataframe/series has. Then identity which one would solve the puzzle.
When my time is up, I just identify how to solve it my way. Then see the solutions on how the problem was solved and study it.
